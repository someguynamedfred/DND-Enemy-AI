# DND AI Generator

Skeleton for a system that automatically names, assigns HP, AC, etc. to a group of enemies to battle against in DND. 

so far, there are the following functions...

1. Dice Roller
input number of dice, number of sides on those dice, and the modifier. Automatically spits out the result.

2. Assign priority
determines who the enemy will target by default

3. call initiative
assigns initiative to enemies

4. damage combatant
indicate which enemy is taking the damage and how much damage they are taking

5. attack round
roll to hit, roll for damage, and determine who is being attacked by the attackers

6. name assign
assigns names to the enemies

Its by no means polished just yet, but it is functional.
